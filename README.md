We present set of reference resources and machine ready spectral
data covering optical bands from UVA through 8000+ Angstroms, based
on our literature/informatics search of bright spectro-photometric
calibration sources suitable for small telescope investigations.
These data are made available as ``.dat'' ASCII whitespace/column
data with absolute units of ergs s-1 cm-2 Angstroms-1. These
catalogs have been translated and augmented for small telescope
spectroscopy using additional data from SIMBAD, GAIA and other
references to produce a PostgreSQL database. We include generic
telluric line table, and files suited to popular
planning/operational planetarium programs. We discuss the salient
aspects of each library reviewed. We include methodology to acquire
spectral measurements of filters and lamp sources common with
photometry and spectroscopy. These data and scripts are available
through an MIT open source license via GitHUB/Docker and, to the
extent possible, are platform agnostic.
